# Multiplayer Search Algorithms and Strategies #
## An evaluation of algorithms ##

General Information
===================
This project was not designed to be a playable game for a user. Instead this was designed to be used as a tool to analyze the effectiveness of different multiplayer search algorithms. This means that the GUI was more of a tool to visually inspect progress of a simulation and to check for bugs.

Driver.java is the entry point. There is a bunch of configuration you can specify in a config file passed as an argument when running (otherwise you will need to manually configure the scenario to run), for valid values see the HonourProjectReport.pdf appendix 1.

What is Included?
